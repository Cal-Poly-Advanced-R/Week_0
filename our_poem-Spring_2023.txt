Let's have a little fun before the code starts executing.
And create a crowd-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:

I don't know how to rhyme, it's a bit confusing.

R can do so many wonderful things, and that can't be missed
When you're working hard at becomming a data scientist!

R is cool, R is great
Until you have a complex function to create
