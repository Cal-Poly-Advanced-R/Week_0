Let's have a little fun before the code starts executing.
And create a crowd-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:

My name is Nils Berzins, and I'm a little worried about this class.
But regardless of my concerns, I'm sure this quarter will be a blast. 

I don't know how to rhyme, it's a bit confusing.

R can do so many wonderful things, and that can't be missed
When you're working hard at becomming a data scientist!
