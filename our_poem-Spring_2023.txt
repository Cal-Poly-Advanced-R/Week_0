Let's have a little fun before the code starts executing.
And create a crowd-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:

I don't know how to rhyme, it's a bit confusing.

R can do so many wonderful things, and that can't be missed
When you're working hard at becomming a data scientist!

I'm so excited for this class
I just know I'm gonna have to work hard to pass!
