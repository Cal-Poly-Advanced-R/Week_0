Let's have a little fun before the code starts executing.
And create a crowd-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:

We'll laugh and joke until the bugs stop misbehaving,
And then we'll get to work, our skills all engaging.

The graphs and models will for sure tell a story,
And we can be certain to bask in that glory.

R can do so many wonderful things, and that can't be missed
When you're working hard at becomming a data scientist!
