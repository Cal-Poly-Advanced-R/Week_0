Let's have a little fun before the code starts executing.
And create a crowd-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:

We'll laugh and joke until the bugs stop misbehaving,
And then we'll get to work, our skills all engaging.

R can do so many wonderful things, and that can't be missed
When you're working hard at becoming a data scientist!

I hope I won't run into the infamous "merge conflict",
but in a collaboratory setting, it's inevitable, I predict.
