Let's have a little fun before the code starts executing.
And create a crowd-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:

We'll laugh and joke until the bugs stop misbehaving,
And then we'll get to work, our skills all engaging.

Wrangle the data and make a graph,
Make no mistake or we'll all laugh.

R can do so many wonderful things, and that can't be missed
When you're working hard at becomming a data scientist!
