After 1 long year of Zooming, and another one of masking,
Some good times with some great students is all I am really asking.
So let's have a little fun before the code starts executing.
And create a crowd-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:


Github allows everyone to work together.
Hopefully our poem is really clever.


Im so exitced for this quarter and working with R, 
Learning more about Github and how its like a working car. 

I am looking for word to working with data too,
and to working with all of you.

I love to code in R, and this is true,
But I have other interests, and I value my free time too.


After a long winter, we have finally made it to the spring
The in-class music is good, but my voice isn't good enough to sing

While I can't wait to graduate soon, 
I am ready to learn until the end of June.

I like to code and read
and value my sleep.

I have Professor Bodwin for STAT 431, 
I learn a ton and have so much fun!


With ANOVA, t-tests, and Bayes galore,
It's nice to have a language where visualization is no chore.


It's been a while since I took 331,
But this week of review should be enough when I'm done.


I woke up this morning feeling very tired.
But after working with R I'm feeling inspired.

I'm excited for this class, 
Let's hope the quarter doesn't go by too fast!

Coding in R can be hard which makes me want to bawl, 
especially when I encounter errors which makes me want to bang my head against the wall.


Working with R is fun
Especially when the assignments are done


Here's to all R related things,
Can't wait to learn all that this class brings!

It's been 2 years since I took 331,
hope this class is just as fun
