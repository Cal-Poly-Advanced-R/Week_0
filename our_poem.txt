As we work through class remotely (hey, at least no more commuting!),
And we learn to talk on Zoom (please don't forget about the muting!),
Let's first have a little fun before the code starts executing.
Please enjoy this crowd-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:

This isn't "twitch writes a poem", but just as good.
I hope you're all ready to maximize some likelihoods!

After teaching us R, I hope you are understood.
After the course is finished, I hope I finished as much work as I could. 

The boredom has set in and the anxiety is growing.
Let's hope they diminish as we begin coding. 

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary...
Just kidding I'm not Poe, now to program in R I go!

R you, oh R you as ready as I am to be out of quarantine? 
On the bright side, perhaps we'll come out of this shiny and well, with an extra shiny app to spare. 

Quarantine got you down?
A little statistical computing can flip that frown! ðŸ¤“

As we begin class ensuring our robust programming skills don't taper
I really hope none of you run out of toliet paper!!

Hoping that this situation doesn't become too much more dire
So I guess I'll wait it out sitting and coding by the fire

I really enjoy ggplot. 
It makes me smile, quite a lot.

People may think that using R is hard, 
And they are right! It will leave you scarred!

Wait you mean we still have class?
Well at least we aren't learning SAS!

Who's watched Tiger King?
