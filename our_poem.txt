As we work through class remotely (hey, at least no more commuting!),
And we learn to talk on Zoom (please don't forget about the muting!),
Let's first have a little fun before the code starts executing.
Please enjoy this crowd-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:

This isn't "twitch writes a poem", but just as good.
I hope you're all ready to maximize some likelihoods!

After teaching us R, I hope you are understood.
After the course is finished, I hope I finished as much work as I could. 

The boredom has set in and the anxiety is growing.
Let's hope they diminish as we begin coding. 

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary...
Just kidding I'm not Poe, now to program in R I go!

R you, oh R you as ready as I am to be out of quarantine? 
On the bright side, perhaps we'll come out of this shiny and well, with an extra shiny app to spare. 

Quarantine got you down?
A little statistical computing can flip that frown! ðŸ¤“

As we begin class ensuring our robust programming skills don't taper
I really hope none of you run out of toliet paper!!

Hoping that this situation doesn't become too much more dire
So I guess I'll wait it out sitting and coding by the fire

I really enjoy ggplot. 
It makes me smile, quite a lot.

People may think that using R is hard, 
And they are right! It will leave you scarred!

Wait you mean we still have class?
Well at least we aren't learning SAS!

If all of us try our very hardest. 
I'm sure that not one of our grades will appear tarnished. 

Oh well, at least it is still Spring,
Let's enjoy the warm weather it is sure to bring!

Sitting in my hometown, not in SLO, crying,
I can't really focus on my work, but I swear I'm trying!

Chilling on github listening to Thundercat
We've got a class poem, now I'm up to bat

Oh no, what has the world become, 
COSAM studs are writing poems for fun

do the r, do it well
mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell

I love cats and palynology
glad that I don't suffer from pollen and cats allergy
